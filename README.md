# Task Tracker done using ReactJS

A basic tast traker built using ReactJS, with functionality to add and delete tasks. The data is stored and can be viewed using this [link](https://reactjs-task-tracker-server.herokuapp.com/tasks). Below is an image of the interface when there are some active tasks to display, and the user has picked the option to add a new task. The about section of the page uses routing, so everything is part of a SPA.
